All three pins functioning (latch, clock, data).

LED lights, sometime after program init.

Most likely in the loop updateShiftRegister() call.

Takes 0xff as input, guaranteeing all LEDs would light.

Can test this in 'hardware' ;)

const int latchPin = 2;  /* STCP */
const int clockPin = 3;  /* SHCP */
const int dataPin  = 4;  /* DS */

versus upstream:

// Trinket M0
int latchPin = 2;
int clockPin = 3;
int dataPin  = 4;
